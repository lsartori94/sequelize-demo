# Node + Sequelize demo

Just a simple demo, training if I may.

Postgre is the DB I choose, running along pgAdmin. Both are in diferent containers.

Nothing fancy, just create DB, create some rows, get all.

### Pre-requisites
- Node, any recent LTS version should work
- Docker

### Wanna see it?
```sh
npm i
sh build-postgre.sh
npm seed
npm start
```
